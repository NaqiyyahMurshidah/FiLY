<h1> What is FiLY</h1>
<h2> FiLY is short for Family I LOVE YOU</h2>
<p> In our IOS Apps where it has an interesting key </p> <br/>
<Strong>First:</Strong>
<p>The document management. where all family document will be centralized in one places. And the original idea of this is the app should be a stronger security of the data and stable database</p>
<Strong>Second:</Strong>
<p>The apps will have a reminder to help family members do their house chores. the original of the idea is the family can add any task to any family member and the task will automatically insert to their calender. </p>
<Strong> Last and not least: </Strong>
<p>The apps should have an virtual album. the idea of this features is exactly like a media social but privately for family only. in this they can interact with each other, share the image to each other and the most important is they can keep save their sweet and precious memory there. </p>

<p> As conclusion this app still has a long journey to go and more improvement need to be done in terms of data storage ( the database), the security and the design itself. </p>
